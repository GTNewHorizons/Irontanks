# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

*Versions prior to 1.1.16 were done on an automated build system which tagged a
new release for every commit (incrementing the patch each time). This was a bit
overeager to tag new versions so many of these versions had no actual changes to
the mod, and no files were actually released. These releases are marked
[SKIPPED] in the changelog.*
